	<h2>A world through the view of an Autistic Child</h2>
  <p>This lab from Mobile class is made to gather information for my son, Eli. As an autistic child his perception of the world is rather different than most children. He is entertained by a wide range of things that might not be interesting to other children. This data collection will be used to find the best sites for him to play. Primarily I will be using this for my own use. But it's possible his mother or future babysitters might use it or utilize the data gathered from it. If you are using this map to document locations you can use either a line to represent a path or walking area. A polygon to represent a large area such as a park, or a point for a specific feature he enjoyed. An example for a line would be walking along the pier, a polygon could be Lion's park, and a point might be a store or solitary set of swings.</p>
